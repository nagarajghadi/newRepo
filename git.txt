What is version control systems ?
Version control systems are used to manage the history of your code. They allow you to track changes to your files and to collaborate with others. Version control systems are essential for software development. Consider version control as a checkpoint in game. You can move to any time in the game and you can always go back to the previous checkpoint. This is the same concept in software development.

Before Git became mainstream, version control systems were used by developers to manage their code. They were called SCCS (Source Code Control System). SCCS was a proprietary software that was used to manage the history of code. It was expensive and not very user-friendly. Git was created to replace SCCS and to make version control more accessible and user-friendly. Some commong version control systems are Subversion (SVN), CVS, and Perforce.
